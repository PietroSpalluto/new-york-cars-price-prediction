In this notebook there are the steps to make a regression model
- Data Cleaning
- EDA
- Data Preprocessing (standardization, dimensionality reduction)
- Model Building (testing different models such as linear regression, neural networks and tree models) using sklearn, pytorch, tensorflow and statsmodels
- Fine tuning once the best performing model is selected we fine tune its parameters using grid search
